# rofi-mpd
This script allows mpd to be controlled by rofi. You can navigate between albums, artists, playlists and individual tracks using only the keyboard.

## Usage
Just run the script.

```sh
$ ./rofi-mpd.sh
```
## Suggestions.

If you use a window manager you can create a keyboard shortcut to have quick access to mpd controls using rofi-mpd.

**Note**: if you want the rofi configuration I use, you can find it [here](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/tree/master/bitmap/blocks/scripts/rofi).
